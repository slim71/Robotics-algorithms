# Nonlinear systems

In this part of the project I've studied the **accessibility, controllability and
observability** of a **nonlinear system**.

When I've started out the study, I was trying to apply my functions to a 
*quadrotor* system, but I've then found out that my code wasn't optimized enough 
to achieve a general symbolic solution.\
I've then used an **Inertia Wheel Pendulum**, with which I've been successful.
