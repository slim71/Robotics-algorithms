# Inverse Kinematics

This has been the main part of the course's practical project.

Considering a **Kuka LWR4+** as manipulator, I've compared the *inverse kinematics*
solution of the **Stack of Tasks** algorithm with the **Reverse Priority** one.\
The main focus was on their differences, problems and advantages, but I also had the chance
to apply a somewhat obscure concept: the **Rank-one update**. 

To be fair, this was *'obscure'* as in *'not properly documented'*, since finding a good
explanation has been tricky for me <u>and</u> for the PhD students tutoring me along the way.\
Once I had reviewed enough sources, the method itself was even a little *underwhelming*.
