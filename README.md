# Robotic control

This repository contains scripts implemented for the course of Robot Control, 
part of the Master Degree in [Robotics and Automation Engineering](http://www.aut.ing.unipi.it/),
attended at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/).

Project started during the early summer of 2021.\
I've struggled a bit with time, since I had a full-time job all the way 
through, but it's been good work.

## Notes on the files included
1. IWP_FL_ToBeChecked &#8594; Attempt at simulating the IWP system along its linearization
2. Linear_IWP &#8594; Simulation of the linear system describing the IWP **after** the feedback linearization

## Backstepping problem
Unfortunately I haven't been able to improve performances of the 
*Backstepping algorithm*. I'm not sure of where the problem lies, so I'm don't
suggest using this as a reference for your problem.

## Status of the project
Right now I've done everything I needed for the project related to my University
exam. The files still need proper comments and help sections, but I'm not sure
when I'll come back to this, or **if**.
