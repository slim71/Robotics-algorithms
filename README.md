# Robotic control

This repository contains scripts implemented for the course of Robot Control, 
part of the Master Degree in [Robotics and Automation Engineering](http://www.aut.ing.unipi.it/),
attended at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/).

Project started during the early summer of 2021.\
I've struggled a bit with time, since I had a full-time job all the way 
through, but it's been good work.
