# Dynamic control

This folder contains the coded used in the study of some *dynamic control* algorithms.

In particular, I've studied the details of:
* Computed torque algorithm
* Backstepping algorithm
* Adaptive computed torque algorithm
* Adaptive backstepping algorithm

within the same application: make the end-effector of an **ABBIRB1600** follow a **circular trajetory**.
